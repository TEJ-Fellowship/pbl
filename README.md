# TEJ - PBL

Welcome to the PBL monorepo ! This repository serves as the central hub for all projects developed during the Full Stack Software Engineering Fellowship program.

## 🚀 Overview

This monorepo contains multiple projects built by our fellows as they progress through the bootcamp curriculum. Each project is designed to reinforce key full-stack development concepts and build practical, portfolio-worthy applications.

**Note**: This is a simple directory-based monorepo - each project manages its own dependencies and can use different tech stacks as needed.

### What You'll Find Here

- **Individual Project Folders**: Each project lives in its own dedicated folder with independent dependencies
- **Documentation**: Project guidelines and development standards
- **Collaborative Learning**: Code reviews, pair programming, and knowledge sharing
- **AI-Enhanced Development**: Leveraging modern AI tools for accelerated learning

## 🛠 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Git**
- **Cursor** (recommended AI-powered code editor)
- **Node.js** (v18 or higher) - for individual projects as needed
- **npm** or **yarn** - for individual projects as needed

### Initial Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd tej-bootcamp-monorepo
   ```

2. **Explore the Structure**
   - Review the folder organization
   - Check out existing projects for inspiration
   - Read the project guidelines (link below)

### Starting Your Project

1. **Create Your Project Folder**

   ```bash
   mkdir your_project_name
   cd your_project_name
   ```

2. **Initialize Your Project**

   ```bash
   npm init -y
   # Set up your frontend/backend structure as needed
   ```

3. **Follow the Development Workflow**
   - Create issues for features
   - Use feature branches
   - Leverage AI tools for learning and development
   - Submit pull requests for code review

## 📋 Development Guidelines

For detailed development standards, workflow processes, and best practices, please refer to our comprehensive guidelines:

**📖 [Project Development Guidelines](docs/project-guidelines.md)**

Key highlights:

- AI-assisted development (encouraged!)
- User story-driven development
- Proper Git workflow and branching strategy
- Code review requirements
- Testing standards

## 🤖 AI-Enhanced Learning

We strongly encourage the use of AI tools throughout your development journey:

- **Learning**: Ask AI to explain complex concepts
- **Development**: Generate boilerplate and get implementation suggestions
- **Debugging**: Get help understanding and fixing errors
- **Code Review**: Request AI feedback on your code quality

Remember: Always understand the AI-generated code before implementing it!

## 🔄 Workflow Summary

1. **Plan**: Create user stories and break them into tasks
2. **Develop**: Use feature branches and leverage AI assistance
3. **Review**: Submit PRs with detailed descriptions
4. **Collaborate**: Participate in code reviews and pair programming
5. **Learn**: Continuously ask questions and seek understanding

## 🤝 Getting Help

- **Technical Questions**: Use GitHub issues for project-specific discussions
- **Pair Programming**: Schedule sessions with fellow bootcampers
- **Mentorship**: Reach out to program mentors for guidance
- **Documentation**: Refer to the guidelines and project READMEs
- **Presentations**: Review our [Presentation Guidelines](docs/presentation_guidelines.md) for project presentations
- **Deployment**: Follow our [Render Deployment Guidelines](docs/deployment_guidelines_render.md) for deploying your applications

## 🎯 Goals

By the end of the bootcamp, you'll have:

- Multiple full-stack projects in your portfolio
- Experience with modern development workflows
- Proficiency in AI-assisted development
- Strong collaboration and code review skills
- A solid foundation in software engineering best practices
