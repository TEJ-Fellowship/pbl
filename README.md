# TEJ - PBL

Welcome to the PBL monorepo ! This repository serves as the central hub for all projects developed during the Full Stack Software Engineering Fellowship program.

## 🚀 Overview

This monorepo contains multiple projects built by our fellows as they progress through the bootcamp curriculum. Each project is designed to reinforce key full-stack development concepts and build practical, portfolio-worthy applications.

**Note**: This is a simple directory-based monorepo - each project manages its own dependencies and can use different tech stacks as needed.

### What You'll Find Here

- **Individual Project Folders**: Each project lives in its own dedicated folder with independent dependencies
- **Documentation**: Project guidelines and development standards
- **Collaborative Learning**: Code reviews, pair programming, and knowledge sharing
- **Modern Development Tools**: Using contemporary development tools and practices
