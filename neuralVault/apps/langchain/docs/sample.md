# Machine Learning Fundamentals

## Introduction

Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and make decisions without being explicitly programmed.

## Types of Machine Learning

### 1. Supervised Learning

- **Definition**: Learning from labeled training data
- **Examples**: Classification, Regression
- **Algorithms**: Linear Regression, Random Forest, Neural Networks

### 2. Unsupervised Learning

- **Definition**: Finding patterns in unlabeled data
- **Examples**: Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction
- **Algorithms**: K-means, PCA, Autoencoders

### 3. Reinforcement Learning

- **Definition**: Learning through interaction with environment
- **Examples**: Game playing, Robotics
- **Algorithms**: Q-Learning, Deep Q-Networks

## Key Concepts

### Feature Engineering

The process of selecting and transforming raw data into features that can be used by machine learning algorithms.

### Model Evaluation

- **Accuracy**: Percentage of correct predictions
- **Precision**: True positives / (True positives + False positives)
- **Recall**: True positives / (True positives + False negatives)
- **F1-Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall

### Overfitting vs Underfitting

- **Overfitting**: Model performs well on training data but poorly on new data
- **Underfitting**: Model performs poorly on both training and new data

## Best Practices

1. Always split data into training, validation, and test sets
2. Use cross-validation for robust model evaluation
3. Regularize models to prevent overfitting
4. Feature scaling for algorithms sensitive to scale
5. Handle missing data appropriately
