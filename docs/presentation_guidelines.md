# PBL Presentation Guidelines

## Overview

**Time:** 12 mins  
**Audience:** Fellow participants, instructors, teaching fellows, and other stakeholders involved in the Bootcamp  
**Format:** In-person with live demonstration  
**Focus:** Web development projects using React and API integration

## Presentation Structure 

### 1. Introduction (1 minute)
- Project name and brief tagline
- Your name and quick personal intro
- Problem statement: What problem does your project solve?
- Tech stack overview: "Built with React, [specific APIs used], and [other technologies]"

### 2. Live Demo (5-6 minutes)
- Start with the end result - show your deployed application first
- Follow a user journey - demonstrate 2-3 key features as a user would experience them
- Highlight API integration - explicitly show where external data is being fetched
- Keep it smooth - practice the demo flow beforehand to avoid dead time

### 3. Project Overview & Learning (3 minutes)
- High-level architecture - explain your project structure without showing code
- Key features implemented - highlight 2-3 main functionalities
- Technologies used - mention React concepts and APIs you integrated with
- Challenges overcome - discuss problems you solved and lessons learned

### 4. Wrap-up & Questions (2 minutes)
- What you learned from building this project
- Future improvements - 1-2 features you'd add next
- Open for questions

## Demonstration Best Practices

### Before Your Presentation
- [ ] Test everything on the presentation setup/projector
- [ ] Have backup plans: Screenshots if live demo fails
- [ ] Clear browser cache and use incognito mode for clean demo
- [ ] Prepare test data - have realistic, clean sample data ready
- [ ] Close unnecessary browser tabs and applications

### During the Demo
- [ ] Zoom in - make sure text/UI is readable from the back of the room
- [ ] Narrate as you click - explain what you're doing as you do it
- [ ] Show responsive design - demonstrate mobile view if implemented
- [ ] Handle errors gracefully - if something breaks, explain what should happen
- [ ] Keep moving - don't spend too long troubleshooting live issues

### Explaining Technical Concepts (Without Code)
- Use analogies - compare your React components to real-world concepts
- Focus on user impact - explain how API integration improves user experience
- Mention technical decisions - "I chose to use React hooks because..." (without showing the code)
- Discuss architecture - describe how different parts of your app work together

## Presentation Delivery Tips

### Voice and Body Language
- Speak clearly and at moderate pace - you have limited time but don't rush
- Make eye contact with different sections of the audience
- Use gestures to emphasize points, especially when pointing at screen elements
- Stand confidently - avoid blocking the screen

### Managing Nerves
- Practice out loud at least 3 times before presenting
- Time yourself - make sure you can comfortably fit everything in 7 minutes
- Focus on your accomplishment - you built something functional!
- Remember your audience - they're fellow learners, not critics

### Handling Questions
- Repeat the question if others might not have heard it
- Be honest about limitations - "I haven't implemented that yet, but here's how I would approach it"
- Offer to connect later for detailed technical discussions

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Don't spend too long on setup/background - jump into the demo quickly
- Don't apologize for incomplete features - focus on what works
- Don't try to show every single feature - pick the most impressive 2-3
- Don't ignore the audience - maintain engagement, don't just stare at your screen
- Don't go over time - respect the schedule and other presenters

## Quick Checklist - Day of Presentation

### 30 minutes before:
- [ ] Test project on presentation computer/network
- [ ] Verify all APIs are working
- [ ] Open your deployed application in browser
- [ ] Prepare any slides or visual aids (if using)

### Right before presenting:
- [ ] Take a deep breath
- [ ] Have water nearby
- [ ] Remember: everyone wants you to succeed!

## Sample Opening Lines

"Hi everyone, I'm [Name] and I built [Project Name] - a React application that helps [solve specific problem] by integrating with [API name] to [specific benefit]. Let me show you how it works."

"Today I'm presenting [Project Name], which demonstrates [key technical concept] using React and [API]. The main challenge I solved was [specific problem], so let's see it in action."

**Remember:** The goal is to showcase both your technical skills and your ability to communicate effectively. Your fellow bootcamp participants want to learn from what you've built, and instructors want to see your growth. Be proud of your work and share your learning journey!
