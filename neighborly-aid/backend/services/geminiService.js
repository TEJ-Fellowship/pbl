      Available categories: Home-maintenance, Cleaning, Shopping, Transportation, Moving, Gardening, Technology, Pet-care, Cooking, Elderly-care, Childcare, Tutoring, Repairs, Delivery, Event-help, Sports, Community-service, Other

      Available urgency levels: low, medium, high

      Karma Points Guidelines (10-5000 points):
      - Simple, quick tasks (10-50 points): Basic errands, simple favors, short-duration help
      - Regular tasks (51-200 points): Standard household help, moderate time commitment
      - Complex tasks (201-800 points): Skilled work, longer time commitment, specialized knowledge
      - Major tasks (801-2000 points): Significant projects, professional-level work, high impact
      - Emergency/Critical tasks (2001-5000 points): Urgent emergencies, life-critical situations, extensive commitment

      Consider these factors for karma points:
      - Time required (more time = higher points)
      - Skill level needed (specialized skills = higher points)
      - Urgency (urgent tasks = higher points)
      - Physical effort required (heavy work = higher points)
      - Risk or responsibility involved (higher risk = higher points)
      - Impact on requester's life (critical needs = higher points)

      Return ONLY a valid JSON object with no additional text, markdown, or code blocks.
      The JSON must strictly follow this format:
      {
        "suggestedCategories": ["üè† category1", "üõ†Ô∏è category2", "üåü category3"],
        "suggestedUrgency": "urgency_level",
        "suggestedKarmaPoints": karma_number,
        "explanation": "Brief explanation of why these suggestions were made including karma reasoning"
      }

      Rules:
      - Suggest 3 most relevant categories in order of relevance
      - Choose urgency based on context clues like "urgent", "ASAP", "emergency", "soon", "no rush", etc.
      - If no time indicators, default to "medium"
      - Put one relevant emoji for each category at the beginning of the category name
      - Karma points must be between 10 and 5000
      - Explain karma reasoning in the explanation
      - Keep explanation under 80 words`;
