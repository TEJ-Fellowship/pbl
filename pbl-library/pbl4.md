## üéÆ Discord Community Support Agent ‚Äì Server Management & Bot Help

**Overview**

Build an intelligent support agent for Discord server administrators and moderators managing community servers, configuring bots, setting up roles and permissions, handling moderation tools, and troubleshooting common issues. Discord hosts 150M+ monthly active users across millions of servers, making community management support critical. This agent handles both non-technical questions (how to create channels, invite members) and technical ones (webhook setup, bot development, API integration). The complexity comes from Discord's extensive permission system, bot ecosystem, and the need to guide users through multi-step server setup processes.

**Real-World Inspiration**
