        "content": "Note The Apple MPP (Mail Privacy Protection) policy for email was released September 21, 2021 with the iOS 15 operating system. With this release, Apple downloads incoming emails on its own server. This makes it appear as if a recipient opened the email, which inflates the sender’s open-related metrics. You have the option to exclude emails opened by Apple MPP from your open-related metrics for emails sent on or after June 22, 2024."
      },
      {
        "heading": "How we calculate open and click rates",
        "content": "The open rate is a percentage that tells you how many successfully delivered emails were opened by recipients. Mailchimp loads a tiny, transparent image into each email and counts how often the image is downloaded for delivered emails. The image is invisible to your recipients. Open rate tracking relies on images, so it isn't 100% accurate. For example, if a recipient's email client has images turned off, the tracking image won't load, and their email won't register as opened. Mailchimp reduces this margin of error by factoring in click-throughs with open rates. Recipients must open an email to click a link inside it. We'll consider those clicks as opens, even if the tracking image didn't load. We recommend that you exclude Apple MPP from your reports for more accurate opens and open-related metrics. To learn more about Apple MPP, check out About Apple Mail Privacy Protection (MPP). Want to know more about different types of opens, including unique opens and total opens? Check out About Email Reports and Use Open Tracking in Emails. The click rate is a percentage that tells you how many delivered emails registered at least 1 click. Your click rate reveals general trends, but isn't detailed. For information about different types of clicks, check out Use Open Tracking in Emails and About Email Reports."

      {
        "heading": "Why open and click rates are important",
        "content": "Open and click rates can give you a good idea of how your emails are performing with a particular audience. A high open rate may mean that your audience is connecting with the subject lines. If your click rates are good, this could mean that your content is important to recipients. Average open and click rates can vary from audience to audience, and differ by industry, company size, and other factors. Check out the Email Marketing Benchmarks report, which can give you an idea of how your rates stack up against similar users. Once you know where you stand, you can use Mailchimp tools such as A/B tests or multivariate tests to test and improve your email marketing. Make time to review your reports after every email, consider what factors might have affected your results, and test."

        "heading": "Test your subject line",
        "content": "A good subject line clearly shows what's in your emails. You'll want to try a few different ones to find out what works best for your audience. Create 2 or 3 subject lines that differ slightly. For example, \"Company 123 Weekly Newsletter\" and \"News from Company 123,\" and set them up in an A/B or multivariate test."

      {
        "heading": "Segment your audience",
        "content": "Think about who your subscribed contacts are and what kind of information is most useful to them. If sales reps, store owners, and consumers all receive the same content, some could become frustrated by irrelevant content and stop opening your emails. Segment your audience based on their location, interests, or actions to send targeted content. Use segments to create stronger emails and build trust with your subscribed contacts."
      },
      {
        "heading": "Change your send frequency",
        "content": "Depending on your email marketing goals, you may send emails 10 times a day or once a quarter. If your open rate is much lower than your industry's benchmark and you're using tested subject lines and targeting your emails, consider testing how often you send. In general, sending more emails negatively impacts the level of engagement per email sent, but it's different for everyone."
      },
      {
        "heading": "How to improve click rates",
        "content": "Your click rate tells you how many of your recipients find your email content useful. To improve your click rate, create content that applies to a wide variety of recipients. Like open rates, you can sometimes achieve this by sending specific content to a smaller, segmented audience. You can also try changing your link text and testing content blocks in your emails."

It also leaves out important information screen readers need for accessibility. Also, \"click here\" suggests clicking a mouse, which doesn't apply for people viewing their emails on a touchscreen. Make your link text descriptive and concise. Your URL should send people to the most important information. If your content is about a service, link to that service's webpage instead of your business homepage."

        "heading": "Embed more links",

You could place donate buttons in several areas, or vary link text throughout your email. Use several links to increase the chances that someone will click them, even if every link points to the same webpage. It's always a good idea to test your links."

Mailchimp will send each version to a different group of people and track their responses. The one that performs better is sent to your subscribed contacts who weren't sent the test versions. Open and click rates improve when you provide relevant content to the most interested group of people. Review your reports and test often to get the most out of your emails."

Keep these common scenarios in mind when working with API keys. Give each integration its own API key. Assign descriptive names to each key so you know which key goes with which app. If a specific API key is compromised, you can revoke that key without disabling access to your other integrations. Be careful not to expose the key to the public (such as in screenshots, videos, or help documents). Remember that blurring your data isn't always enough. It's best to remove the data completely. Because of the potential security risks that come with exposing account API keys, Mailchimp doesn’t support client-side implementation of our API using CORS requests or including API keys in mobile apps. If you need to share access to your account, generate a new key and name it so you’ll know which key to revoke, if needed. Never email an API key. This could allow access to your Mailchimp account if hackers were to compromise your email account. If you revoke a user's access to your Mailchimp account, we’ll remove any API keys that user generated from your account. The role of the user who generated the API key determines access to each endpoint. To learn more about user level permissions, visit Manage User Levels in Your Account."
