## Project 4: üìß Mailchimp Support Agent ‚Äì Email Marketing & Automation Help

**Overview**

Develop a support agent for Mailchimp users creating email campaigns, building automation workflows, managing subscriber lists, and interpreting analytics. Mailchimp serves small businesses and marketers who often lack technical expertise, requiring clear, jargon-free explanations. The agent handles everything from "How do I create my first campaign?" to "Why is my open rate low?" This project is excellent for learning how to explain complex marketing concepts simply while providing actionable, data-driven advice.

**Real-World Inspiration**  
Inspired by [Mailchimp's Help Center](https://mailchimp.com/help/) and their in-app contextual help. Mailchimp uses AI to suggest content blocks, subject lines, and send-time optimization.
