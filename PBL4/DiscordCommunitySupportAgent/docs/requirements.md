## Project 1: üéÆ Discord Community Support Agent ‚Äì Server Management & Bot Help

**Overview**

Build an intelligent support agent for Discord server administrators and moderators managing community servers, configuring bots, setting up roles and permissions, handling moderation tools, and troubleshooting common issues. Discord hosts 150M+ monthly active users across millions of servers, making community management support critical. This agent handles both non-technical questions (how to create channels, invite members) and technical ones (webhook setup, bot development, API integration). The complexity comes from Discord's extensive permission system, bot ecosystem, and the need to guide users through multi-step server setup processes.

**Real-World Inspiration**  
Modeled after [Discord's Support Center](https://support.discord.com/) and their in-app help system. Discord uses AI-powered search across help articles and has community-driven support through their official server.

**Tier 1: Basic RAG Chat** ‚è±Ô∏è _Days 1-3_

- Scrape 3 core sections (Server Setup, Roles & Permissions, Moderation) with Cheerio
- Chunk docs into 700 tokens with RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter, preserve step-by-step guides
- Embed with OpenAI text-embedding-3-small, store in Chroma (local)
- Terminal-based Q&A with colored output (chalk)
- Single-turn conversations, preserve Discord emoji indicators (‚öôÔ∏è, üîí, ‚ûï)

**Tier 2: Production RAG + Context** ‚è±Ô∏è _Days 4-7_

- Scrape all 10 sources with content-type detection (support articles, API docs, policies)
- Hybrid search: Semantic (Chroma) + BM25 keyword (FlexSearch) with 0.65/0.35 weighting
- Re-rank with cross-encoder (Transformers.js)
- React UI styled like Discord (dark theme, similar colors) + Express API
- Conversation memory tracking server context (size, purpose: gaming/study/community)
- MongoDB for conversation storage, Discord-style markdown formatting
- Source citations with expandable accordions, code blocks with syntax highlighting

**Tier 3: MCP + Advanced Features** ‚è±Ô∏è _Days 8-11_

- **MCP Tools:** Brave web search, permission calculator (bitfield math), Discord status checker, bot token validator, webhook tester, role hierarchy checker
- Multi-turn context compression, query classification (setup/moderation/bots/API)
- Confidence scoring with auto-escalation (<0.5): "Check Discord's official support server"
- PostgreSQL analytics: top questions by category, time-based patterns, escalation rate
- Feedback loop with thumbs up/down, weekly retraining of retrieval weights
- Special handling for permission queries (many similar docs need precise ranking)

**Tier 4: Enterprise-Grade** ‚è±Ô∏è _Days 12-14_

- Multi-tenant for different server types (gaming/education/business communities)
- Admin dashboard: knowledge management, real-time analytics (Socket.io), performance metrics
- A/B testing framework: tone (formal vs. friendly), response length, model variants
- **Discord Bot deployment** (discord.js): slash commands `/help [question]`, DM support, server-specific customization
- Advanced RAG: HyDE, query expansion, parent-child chunks, query rewriting
- **Guardrails:** Bot token detection and auto-redaction (‚ö†Ô∏è critical security feature), toxicity filtering, PII masking, rate limiting (Redis)
- Zapier webhooks for monitoring, Zendesk integration for escalation
- CI/CD with automated evaluation suite (250 golden Q&A pairs, RAGAS metrics)
- **Unique security focus:** 100% bot token detection rate to prevent credential leaks

**Tech Stack:** React, Express, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Chroma, OpenAI, MCP SDK, discord.js, Transformers.js, Socket.io
