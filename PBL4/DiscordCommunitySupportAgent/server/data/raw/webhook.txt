Webhook Resource

Webhooks are a low-effort way to post messages to channels in Discord. They do not require a bot user or authentication to use.

Apps can also subscribe to webhook events (i.e. outgoing webhooks) when events happen in Discord, which is detailed in the Webhook Events documentation.

Webhook Object

Used to represent a webhook.

Webhook Structure

guild_id?	?snowflake	the guild id this webhook is for, if any
channel_id	?snowflake	the channel id this webhook is for, if any
user?	user object	the user this webhook was created by (not returned when getting a webhook with its token)

Execute Webhook
POST
/webhooks/{webhook.id}/{webhook.token}

Refer to Uploading Files for details on attachments and multipart/form-data requests. Returns a message or 204 No Content depending on the wait query parameter.

Note that when sending a message, you must provide a value for at least one of content, embeds, components, file, or poll.
If the webhook channel is a forum or media channel, you must provide either thread_id in the query string params, or thread_name in the JSON/form params. If thread_id is provided, the message will send in that thread. If thread_name is provided, a thread with that name will be created in the channel.
Discord may strip certain characters from message content, like invalid unicode characters or characters which cause unexpected message formatting. If you are passing user-generated strings into message content, consider sanitizing the data to prevent unexpected behavior and using allowed_mentions to prevent unexpected mentions.
Query String Params
FIELD	TYPE	DESCRIPTION	REQUIRED
wait	boolean	waits for server confirmation of message send before response, and returns the created message body (defaults to false; when false a message that is not saved does not return an error)	false
thread_id	snowflake	Send a message to the specified thread within a webhook's channel. The thread will automatically be unarchived.	false
with_components	boolean	whether to respect the components field of the request. When enabled, allows application-owned webhooks to use all components and non-owned webhooks to use non-interactive components. (defaults to false)	false
JSON/Form Params
FIELD	TYPE	DESCRIPTION	REQUIRED
content	string	the message contents (up to 2000 characters)	one of content, file, embeds, poll
username	string	override the default username of the webhook	false
avatar_url	string	override the default avatar of the webhook	false
tts	boolean	true if this is a TTS message	false
embeds	array of up to 10 embed objects	embedded rich content	one of content, file, embeds, poll
allowed_mentions	allowed mention object	allowed mentions for the message	false
components *	array of message component	the components to include with the message	false
files[n] **	file contents	the contents of the file being sent	one of content, file, embeds, poll
payload_json **	string	JSON encoded body of non-file params	multipart/form-data only
attachments **	array of partial attachment objects	attachment objects with filename and description	false

applied_tags	array of snowflakes	array of tag ids to apply to the thread (requires the webhook channel to be a forum or media channel)	false
poll	poll request object	A poll!	one of content, file, embeds, poll

* Application-owned webhooks can always send components. Non-application-owned webhooks cannot send interactive components, and the components field will be ignored unless they set the with_components query param.

** See Uploading Files for details.

*** When the flag IS_COMPONENTS_V2 is set, the webhook message can only contain components. Providing content, embeds, files[n] or poll will fail with a 400 BAD REQUEST response.

For the webhook embed objects, you can set every field except type (it will be rich regardless of if you try to set it), provider, video, and any height, width, or proxy_url values for images.
Execute Slack-Compatible Webhook
POST
/webhooks/{webhook.id}/{webhook.token}/slack

Refer to Slack's documentation for more information. We do not support Slack's channel, icon_emoji, mrkdwn, or mrkdwn_in properties.

Execute GitHub-Compatible Webhook
POST
/webhooks/{webhook.id}/{webhook.token}/github

Add a new webhook to your GitHub repo (in the repo's settings), and use this endpoint as the "Payload URL." You can choose what events your Discord channel receives by choosing the "Let me select individual events" option and selecting individual events for the new webhook you're configuring. The supported events are commit_comment, create, delete, fork, issue_comment, issues, member, public, pull_request, pull_request_review, pull_request_review_comment, push, release, watch, check_run, check_suite, discussion, and discussion_comment.

GET
/webhooks/{webhook.id}/{webhook.token}/messages/{message.id}

Returns a previously-sent webhook message from the same token. Returns a message object on success.

Query String Params

Edit Webhook Message
PATCH
/webhooks/{webhook.id}/{webhook.token}/messages/{message.id}

Edits a previously-sent webhook message from the same token. Returns a message object on success.

When the content field is edited, the arrays mentions and mention_roles and the boolean mention_everyone in the message object will be reconstructed from scratch based on the new content. When the message flag IS_COMPONENTS_V2 is set, the reconstructed arrays and boolean are based on the edited content in the components array. The allowed_mentions field of the edit request controls how this happens. If there is no explicit allowed_mentions in the edit request, the content will be parsed with default allowances, that is, without regard to whether or not an allowed_mentions was present in the request that originally created the message.

Refer to Uploading Files for details on attachments and multipart/form-data requests. Any provided files will be appended to the message. To remove or replace files you will have to supply the attachments field which specifies the files to retain on the message after edit.

Starting with API v10, the attachments array must contain all attachments that should be present after edit, including retained and new attachments provided in the request body.
All parameters to this endpoint are optional and nullable.
Query String Params
FIELD	TYPE	DESCRIPTION	REQUIRED
thread_id	snowflake	id of the thread the message is in	false
with_components	boolean	whether to respect the components field of the request. When enabled, allows application-owned webhooks to use all components and non-owned webhooks to use non-interactive components. (defaults to false)	false
JSON/Form Params
FIELD	TYPE	DESCRIPTION

payload_json ***	string	JSON encoded body of non-file params (multipart/form-data only)
attachments ***	array of partial attachment objects	attached files to keep and possible descriptions for new files
poll ****	poll request object	A poll!

* The SUPPRESS_EMBEDS flag can be both set and unset, while the IS_COMPONENTS_V2 flag can only be set. When the IS_COMPONENTS_V2 flag is set, any of the used content, embeds, files[n] or poll values in the initial message must be set to null first, otherwise it will fail with a 400 BAD REQUEST response.

** Application-owned webhooks can always send components. Non-application-owned webhooks cannot send interactive components, and the components field will be ignored unless they set the with_components query param.

*** See Uploading Files for details.

**** Polls can only be added when editing a deferred interaction response.
