When you first create your server there is only one pre-made role: @everyone. The @everyone role defines the permissions that are enabled for everyone on your server even if they have no other roles assigned to them.

Note: As the creator of your server you don't need to assign any roles or permissions to yourself. You will always have access to everything.
Press on the downward arrow next to the server name.
Choose Server Settings > Roles > Create Role.

Step 2 - Customize Role And Permissions
Give the new role a name. You can always change this later! Feel free to change the display of this role at this point, but for this article, we'll focus on Permissions.
