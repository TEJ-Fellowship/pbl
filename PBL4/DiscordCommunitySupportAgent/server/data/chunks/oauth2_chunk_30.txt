In the case of bots, the scope parameter should be set to bot. There's also a new parameter, permissions, which is an integer corresponding to the permission calculations for the bot. You'll also notice the absence of response_type and redirect_uri. Bot authorization does not require these parameters because there is no need to retrieve the user's access token.
