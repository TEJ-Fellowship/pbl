Understanding Synced And Not-Synced Permissions

There are two default states for a channel in regards to category permissions: synced and not-synced. A synced channel will have permissions that completely match that of the category. A not-synced channel will have permissions that differ from the permissions set for the category.

A synced channel!

A not synced channel!

If you change the permissions on a category, all channels that are synced will automatically update.
