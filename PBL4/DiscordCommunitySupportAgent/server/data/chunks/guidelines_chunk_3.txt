Our Trust & Safety team reviews reports by users, moderators, trusted third-party partners, or where required by law. When we proactively or reactively discover a violation of these Guidelines, we may take a number of enforcement steps based on the severity of the violation, including issuing warnings, removing content, temporarily suspending account access to Discord, or permanently removing violative accounts and servers, and even reporting them to law enforcement. We may also consider relevant off-platform behavior when making assessments for violations of specific Community Guidelines.
