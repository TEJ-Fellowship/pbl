Having the user's access token allows your application to make certain requests to the API on their behalf, restricted to whatever scopes were requested. expires_in is how long, in seconds, until the returned access token expires, allowing you to anticipate the expiration and refresh the token. To refresh, make another POST request to the token URL with the following parameters:

grant_type - must be set to refresh_token
