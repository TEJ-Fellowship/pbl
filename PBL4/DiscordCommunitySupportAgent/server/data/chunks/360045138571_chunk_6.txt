What Are Text And Voice Channels? 

Your server is made up of text channels and voice channels. This allows you to communicate with the other members of the server.

Text Channels

Text channels provide dedicated spaces for written conversations, helping to keep discussions organized and ensuring everyone has room to participate. You can create individual channels for each topic your group enjoys discussing—whether that's planning fishing trips, sharing cooking tips, or any other shared interests.
