Right-click on the not-synced channel and choose Edit Channel from the drop-down menu.
Press the Permissions option in the left-hand panel.
Press the Sync Now button and the channel's permission will match the permissions of the category.

Note: Synced and not-synced channels can coexist within a category. Changing a category’s permissions will change all synced channel’s permissions, but not the permissions of any not-synced channel!

One final note on category permissions - if you don't want to utilize them at all, you can leave all channels within the category as "not synced" and manage them individually. Permissions can also be managed on a per-channel basis.
