Step 2 - Customize Role And Permissions
Give the new role a name. You can always change this later! Feel free to change the display of this role at this point, but for this article, we'll focus on Permissions.
Select on the Permissions tab of the new role you just created to see the list of server Permissions you can assign under this role.
Make sure to consider what you want users in this role to do in your server when choosing permissions.
Don't forget to Save the changes you're making to this role!

Step 3 - Assign The Role

Finally, once you've configured the role's permission, you can assign the role to members of your server.
