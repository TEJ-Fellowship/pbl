Authorization Code Grant

The authorization code grant is what most developers will recognize as "standard OAuth2" and involves retrieving an access code and exchanging it for a user's access token. It allows the authorization server to act as an intermediary between the client and the resource owner, so the resource owner's credentials are never shared directly with the client.
