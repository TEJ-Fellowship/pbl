From this object, you should store the webhook.token and webhook.id. See the execute webhook documentation for how to send messages with the webhook.

Any user that wishes to add your webhook to their channel will need to go through the full OAuth2 flow. A new webhook is created each time, so you will need to save the token and id. If you wish to send a message to all your webhooks, you'll need to iterate over each stored id
combination and make POST requests to each one. Be mindful of our Rate Limits!
