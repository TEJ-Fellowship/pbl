Quick Example: GitHub Webhook Integration

Since webhooks can't really function on their own and need to be linked to another website to function as intended, I figured it'd be best to include a sample integration for any of you GitHub enthusiasts and code-pushers.

You can use Discord's webhooks to send any code merge or push updates in a repository of yours into a text channel in your server.  

1. Get the webhook URL for the server/channel you want to receive messages:

In my server, I've created a text channel labeled #general-chat and I want my repo updates to post messages here!
