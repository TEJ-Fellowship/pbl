Server owners must apply an age-restricted label to any channels that contain sexually explicit content involving adults or content involving adults that is shared solely for the purposes of sexual gratification.


Users may not post sexually explicit content in any space that cannot be age-restricted, including in avatars, custom statuses or bios, server banners, server icons, invite splashes, emoji, and stickers. (See our Sexual Content Policy Explainer for more.)
