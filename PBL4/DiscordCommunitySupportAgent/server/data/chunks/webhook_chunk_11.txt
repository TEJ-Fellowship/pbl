If the webhook channel is a forum or media channel, you must provide either thread_id in the query string params, or thread_name in the JSON/form params. If thread_id is provided, the message will send in that thread. If thread_name is provided, a thread with that name will be created in the channel.
Discord may strip certain characters from message content, like invalid unicode characters or characters which cause unexpected message formatting. If you are passing user-generated strings into message content, consider sanitizing the data to prevent unexpected behavior and using allowed_mentions to prevent unexpected mentions.
