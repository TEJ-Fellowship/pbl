7. If you are under the age of 18, you may not engage in sexual conduct or any other conduct using Discord that puts your online or physical safety at risk. This includes consensual sexual interactions between you and other teens of a similar age, as well as any encouragement or coordination of behavior that may be harmful for you or others, such as vigilantism.


We want teens to be able to express themselves as authentically as possible on Discord. However, given the risks associated with online dating, we will remove spaces that encourage or facilitate dating between teens. (See our Teen and Child Safety Policy Explainer and our Teen Safety Assist function for more.)
