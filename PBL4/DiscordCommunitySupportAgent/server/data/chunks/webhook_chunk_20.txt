When the content field is edited, the arrays mentions and mention_roles and the boolean mention_everyone in the message object will be reconstructed from scratch based on the new content. When the message flag IS_COMPONENTS_V2 is set, the reconstructed arrays and boolean are based on the edited content in the components array. The allowed_mentions field of the edit request controls how this happens. If there is no explicit allowed_mentions in the edit request, the content will be parsed with default allowances, that is, without regard to whether or not an allowed_mentions was present in the request that originally created the message.
