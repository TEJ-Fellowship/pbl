Therefore, I'll grab the webhook URL for this channel by pressing the Copy Webhook URL button:

2. Add the webhook URL into your GitHub repo settings

Choose the repository that you'd like to get updates from in your Discord server. Once you've selected the repo, go into the Settings > Webhooks menu

And then click the "Add webhook" button, and enter the Discord-generated URL in the "Payload URL" blank. 

To make the webhook display messages properly, it's really really really REALLY really important that you append '/github' at the end of it. Yes, like five-reallys important.
