Webhook Resource

Webhooks are a low-effort way to post messages to channels in Discord. They do not require a bot user or authentication to use.

Apps can also subscribe to webhook events (i.e. outgoing webhooks) when events happen in Discord, which is detailed in the Webhook Events documentation.
