RESPECT EACH OTHER

1. Do not promote, coordinate, or engage in harassment. We do not allow any type of harassing behavior, including sexual harassment, ban or block evasion, or coordinating server joins for the purpose of harassing server members, also referred to as “server raiding." (See our Bullying, Harassment, and Threats Policy Explainer for more.)


2. Do not threaten to harm another individual or group of people. This includes direct, indirect, and suggestive threats. (See our Bullying, Harassment, and Threats Policy Explainer for more.)
