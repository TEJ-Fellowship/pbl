DISCORD COMMUNITY GUIDELINES
Effective: September 29, 2025

Discord enables you to build meaningful connections around the joy of playing games through voice, video and text features. Our Community Guidelines ensure everyone can express themselves and find community — but not at the expense of anyone else.
