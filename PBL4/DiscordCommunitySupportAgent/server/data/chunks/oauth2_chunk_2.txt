The first step in implementing OAuth2 is registering a developer application and retrieving your client ID and client secret. Most people who will be implementing OAuth2 will want to find and utilize a library in the language of their choice. For those implementing OAuth2 from scratch, please see RFC 6749 for details. After you create your application with Discord, make sure that you have your client_id and client_secret handy. The next step is to figure out which OAuth2 flow is right for your purposes.
