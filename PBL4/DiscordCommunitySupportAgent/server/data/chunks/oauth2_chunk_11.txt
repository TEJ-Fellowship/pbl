When a user begins an authorization flow on the client, a state is generated that is unique to that user's request. This value is stored somewhere only accessible to the client and the user, i.e. protected by the same-origin policy. When the user is redirected, the state parameter is returned. The client validates the request by checking that the state returned matches the stored value. If they match, it is a valid authorization request. If they do not match, it's possible that someone intercepted the request or otherwise falsely authorized themselves to another user's resources, and the request should be denied.
