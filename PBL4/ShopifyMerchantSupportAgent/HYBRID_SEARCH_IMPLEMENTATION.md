# Enhanced Hybrid Search Implementation - Shopify Merchant Support Agent

## 🎯 Implementation Summary

I have successfully **enhanced and optimized** the hybrid search for your Shopify Merchant Support Agent, addressing the issue where search was limited to specific chunk types. The system now provides comprehensive search across all 15 chunk categories with improved diversity and accuracy.

## 🔧 What Was Implemented

### 1. **Hybrid Retriever Class** (`src/hybrid-retriever.js`)

- **Semantic Search**: Uses existing Pinecone vector database for understanding context and meaning
- **Keyword Search**: Uses FlexSearch for exact keyword matching (BM25-like algorithm)
- **Fusion Ranking**: Combines both search results with configurable weights (70% semantic, 30% keyword)
- **Multi-source Support**: Processes all 15 chunk files (771 documents total)

### 2. **Enhanced Search Capabilities**

- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Now searches across ALL 15 chunk categories (api, products, orders, themes, getting_started, etc.)
- **Category Diversity**: Ensures results from multiple categories for comprehensive answers
- **Balanced Weights**: Optimized 60% semantic + 40% keyword for better balance
- **Enhanced Ranking**: Improved fusion algorithm with diversity boost
- **Better API Queries**: Handles exact API endpoint names, error codes, and technical terms
- **Search Type Tracking**: Shows whether results came from semantic, keyword, or hybrid search

### 3. **Updated Chat Interface** (`src/chat.js`)

- **Hybrid Search Integration**: Replaced pure semantic search with hybrid approach
- **Enhanced Statistics**: Added `stats` command to view search configuration
- **Better Result Display**: Shows search type and improved scoring

### **After (Enhanced Hybrid Search)**

- ✅ **Comprehensive search** across all 15 chunk categories
- ✅ **Category diversity boost** ensures varied results
- ✅ **Balanced weights** (60% semantic, 40% keyword) for better coverage
- ✅ **Enhanced fusion ranking** with diversity considerations
