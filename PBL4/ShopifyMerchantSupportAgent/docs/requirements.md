## Project 2: üì¶ Shopify Merchant Support Agent ‚Äì Store Setup & Troubleshooting

**Overview**

Create a support agent for Shopify merchants navigating store setup, theme customization, app integrations, payment gateway configuration, and shipping policies. Shopify serves 2M+ merchants worldwide, making merchant support a critical area. This agent handles both non-technical questions (pricing plans, policy setup) and technical ones (Liquid templating, API usage). The complexity comes from Shopify's vast ecosystem of themes, apps, and integrations, requiring the agent to navigate product-specific documentation across multiple domains.

**Real-World Inspiration**  
Inspired by [Shopify Help Center's](https://help.shopify.com/) AI assistant "Shopify Magic" and their community forums. Shopify uses AI to deflect common support tickets and guide merchants through setup wizards.
