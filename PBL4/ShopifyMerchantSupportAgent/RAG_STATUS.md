### ✅ RAG Pipeline Flow (Fully Operational):

```
User Question → Embedding → Pinecone Vector Search → Retrieved Context → LLM Generation → Response
```

### ✅ Key Components Working:

- **Retriever** (`src/retriever.js`): ✅ Queries Pinecone with embeddings
- **Embeddings** (`src/utils/embeddings.js`): ✅ Converts text to vectors
- **Chat Interface** (`src/chat.js`): ✅ Orchestrates the RAG process
- **Pinecone Config** (`config/pinecone.js`): ✅ Manages Pinecone connection
- **Code Blocks Support**: ✅ Enhanced with code_blocks metadata
- **Gemini AI Integration**: ✅ Using gemini-2.5-flash model

### ✅ Commands to Use:

```bash
# Test Pinecone connection
npm run test-pinecone
