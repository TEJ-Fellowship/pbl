# RAG Implementation Status - Shopify Merchant Support Agent

## ✅ CONFIRMED: LLM is responding from Pinecone Vector Database

The backend terminal chat (`chat.js`) is correctly configured to use Pinecone vector database for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation).

### Evidence from Test Run:

1. **Pinecone Connection**: ✅ Connected successfully
2. **Vector Search**: ✅ "Searching Pinecone vector database..."
3. **Embedding Process**: ✅ "Query embedded, searching vectors..."
4. **Retrieved Results**: ✅ Found 4 relevant sections with similarity scores:
   - Intro to Shopify (Score: 0.6344)
   - Intro to Shopify (Score: 0.6344)
   - Products (Score: 0.6095)
   - Products (Score: 0.6095)
5. **RAG Response**: ✅ Generated answer using retrieved context

### RAG Pipeline Flow:

```
User Question → Embedding → Pinecone Vector Search → Retrieved Context → LLM Generation → Response
```

### Key Components Working:

- **Retriever** (`src/retriever.js`): Queries Pinecone with embeddings
- **Embeddings** (`src/utils/embeddings.js`): Converts text to vectors
- **Chat Interface** (`src/chat.js`): Orchestrates the RAG process
- **Pinecone Config** (`config/pinecone.js`): Manages Pinecone connection

### Commands to Use:

```bash
# Test Pinecone connection
npm run test-pinecone

# Start RAG chat (uses Pinecone)
npm run chat

# Scrape and ingest data (if needed)
npm run scrape
npm run ingest
```

The system is working as intended - the LLM responses are generated using context retrieved from the Pinecone vector database, not from locally stored data.
