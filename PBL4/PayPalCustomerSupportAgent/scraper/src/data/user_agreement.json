When PayPal places a temporary hold on a payment, the money is not available to either the sender or the recipient. PayPal reviews many factors before placing a hold on a payment, including: account tenure, transaction activity, business type, past customer disputes, and overall customer satisfaction. Some common situations where PayPal will hold payments include:\nNew sellers or sellers who have limited selling activity.\n    Payments for higher-risk categories like electronics or tickets.\n    Sellers who have performance issues, or a high rate of buyer dissatisfaction or disputes.\nHolds based on PayPal’s risk decisions\nWe may place a hold on payments sent to your PayPal account if, in our sole discretion, we believe that there may be a high level of risk associated with you, your PayPal account, or your transactions or that placing such a hold is necessary to comply with state or federal regulatory requirements. We make decisions about whether to place a payment hold based on a number of factors, including information available to us from both internal sources and third parties. When we place a hold on a payment, the funds will appear in your PayPal account with an indication that they are unavailable or pending. We’ll notify you, either through your PayPal account or directly by phone or email, whenever we place a hold.\nRisk-based holds generally remain in place for up to 21 days from the date the payment was received into your PayPal account. We may release the hold earlier under certain circumstances (for example, if you’ve uploaded shipment tracking information related to the transaction), but any earlier release is at our sole discretion. The hold may last longer than 21 days if the payment is challenged as a payment that should be invalidated and reversed based on a disputed transaction as discussed in the following paragraph below. In this case, we’ll hold the payment in your PayPal account until the matter is resolved (but no longer than 180 days).\nHolds related to Marketplace transactions\nIf you’re a seller on a marketplace or through a third-party application where PayPal is offered, a hold may be placed on a payment sent to you at the instruction of the applicable marketplace or third party. This is done once you have granted us permission to have your funds held and will be in accordance with your agreement with the third party. These holds will appear in your PayPal account. If you have questions about why the applicable marketplace or third party instructed PayPal to put these holds in place, you will need to contact the marketplace or third party directly.\nHolds based on disputed transactions\nIf a payment sent to you as a seller is challenged as a payment that should be invalidated and reversed, we may place a temporary hold on the funds in your PayPal account to cover the amount that could be reversed. Any of the situations described under Refunds, Reversals and Chargebacks are situations that could result in us placing a hold on a payment. If we determine the transaction should not be reversed, we’ll lift the temporary hold. If we determine the transaction should be reversed, we’ll remove the funds from your PayPal account."

When we place a reserve on your business account, it means that all or some portion of the money in your business account is reserved as unavailable for withdrawal in order to protect against the risk of transactions made by you being reversed or invalidated or any other risk related to your business account or use of the PayPal services. We make decisions about whether to place a reserve based on a number of factors, including information available to us from both internal sources and from third parties.\nPayPal considers a list of non-exclusive factors and whether and how these factors have changed over time, including:\nHow long you have been in business.\n    Whether your industry has a higher likelihood of chargebacks.\n    Your payment processing history with PayPal and other providers.\n    Your business and/or personal credit history.\n    Your delivery time frames.\n    Whether you have higher than average number of returns, chargebacks, claims or disputes.\nThere are two categories of reserves that may be placed on your business account, and one or both may be applied at the same time:\nA Rolling reserve is a reserve where a percentage of each transaction you receive each day is held and then released later on a scheduled basis. For example, your reserve could be set at 10% and held for a 90-day rolling period – meaning 10% of the money you receive on day 1 is held and then released on day 91, 10% of the money you receive on day 2 is held until day 92, etc. Rolling reserves are the most common type of reserve.\n    A Minimum reserve is a specific minimum amount of money that you’re required to keep available in the balance of your business account at all times. The minimum reserve is either taken as an upfront amount deposited all at once (also known as an Upfront reserve) or is established on a rolling basis from percentages of sales until the minimum reserve is achieved, much like a rolling reserve.\nIf we place a reserve on funds in your account, the funds will be shown as \"pending\" and we’ll notify you of the terms of the reserve.If we change the terms of the reserve due to a change in our risk assessment, we’ll notify you of the new terms."

The Notice of Dispute requirements are essential in order to give the parties a meaningful chance to resolve disputes informally.\nProhibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief\nYou and PayPal agree that each of us may bring claims against the other only on an individual basis and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative action or proceeding. Unless both you and PayPal agree otherwise, the arbitrator(s) may not consolidate or join more than one person’s or party’s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a consolidated, representative or class proceeding. Also, the arbitrator(s) may award relief (including monetary, injunctive and declaratory relief) only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief necessitated by that party’s individual claim(s). Any relief awarded cannot affect other PayPal customers.\nArbitration Procedures\nArbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator or arbitrators instead of a judge or jury, and court review of an arbitration award is very limited. However, the arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that a court of competent jurisdiction shall decide issues relating to arbitrability, the scope or enforceability of this Agreement to Arbitrate and issues that this Agreement to Arbitrate indicates that a court can resolve.\nAny arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (referred to as the \"AAA\"). For all claims in which the value of the relief sought is $10,000 U.S. dollars or less, the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules, as modified by this Agreement to Arbitrate, shall apply without exception. For all other claims, the AAA’s rules, including, as applicable, the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules, as modified by this Agreement to Arbitrate, shall apply. The AAA’s rules are available at www.adr.org. In the event that the AAA is unavailable to administer the arbitration, another administrator will be selected by the parties or by the court.\nAny arbitration hearings shall be held in the county in which you reside or at another mutually agreed location. If the value of the relief sought is $25,000 or less, the arbitration will be conducted based solely on written submissions, unless any party requests an in-person, telephonic, or videoconference hearing or the arbitrator decides that a hearing is necessary. In cases where an in-person hearing is held, you and/or PayPal may attend by telephone or videoconference, unless the arbitrator requires otherwise.\nThe arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with applicable law, including recognized principles of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. No court or arbitrator shall be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different PayPal customers, but a court or arbitrator will be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same PayPal customer to the extent required by applicable law. The award of the arbitrator shall be final and binding, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.\nCosts of Arbitration\nPayment of all AAA or arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA’s rules, unless otherwise stated in this Agreement to Arbitrate. If the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, at your request, PayPal will pay all AAA or arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration. Any request for payment of fees by PayPal should be submitted by mail to the AAA along with your Demand for Arbitration and PayPal will make arrangements to pay all necessary fees directly to the AAA. If the value of the relief sought is more than $10,000 and you are able to demonstrate that the costs of accessing arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of accessing a court for purposes of pursuing litigation on an individual basis, PayPal will pay as much of the AAA or arbitrator fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the cost of accessing the arbitration from being prohibitive. In the event the arbitrator determines that either the substance of your or PayPal’s claim or the relief sought was frivolous or brought for an improper purpose, then you or PayPal may seek to recover from you or PayPal any fees it paid, including attorneys’ fees, to the extent permitted by the AAA’s rules and applicable law.\nSeverability\nWith the exception of any of the provisions in the Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief section above, if a court decides that any part of this Agreement to Arbitrate is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of this Agreement to Arbitrate shall still apply. If a court decides that any of the provisions in the Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief section above is invalid or unenforceable because it would prevent the exercise of a non-waivable right to pursue public injunctive relief, then any dispute regarding the entitlement to such relief (and only that relief) must be severed from arbitration and may be litigated in court. All other disputes subject to arbitration under the terms of the Agreement to Arbitrate shall be arbitrated under its terms.\nOpt-Out Procedure\nIf you are a new PayPal customer, you can choose to reject this Agreement to Arbitrate by mailing us a written opt-out notice. The opt-out notice must be postmarked no later than 30 days after the date you accept this user agreement for the first time. You must mail the opt-out notice to PayPal, Inc., Attn: Litigation Department, 2211 North First Street, San Jose, CA 95131.\nFor your convenience, we are providing an opt-out notice form you must complete and mail to opt out of this Agreement to Arbitrate. You must complete this form by providing all the information it calls for, including your name, address, phone number, and the email address(es) used to log in to the PayPal account(s) to which the opt-out applies. You must sign the opt-out notice for it to be effective. This procedure is the only way you can opt out of the Agreement to Arbitrate. If you opt out of this Agreement to Arbitrate, all other parts of the user agreement will continue to apply. Opting out of this Agreement to Arbitrate has no effect on any previous, other, or future arbitration agreements that you may have with us.\nFuture Amendments to this Agreement to Arbitrate\nNotwithstanding any provision in the user agreement to the contrary, you and we agree that if we make any amendment to this Agreement to Arbitrate (other than an amendment to any notice address or website link provided herein) in the future, that amendment shall not apply to any claim that was filed in a legal proceeding against PayPal or you prior to the effective date of the amendment. The amendment shall apply to all other disputes or claims governed by this Agreement to Arbitrate that have arisen or may arise between you and PayPal. We will notify you of amendments to this Agreement to Arbitrate by posting the amended terms on www.paypal.com at least 30 days before the effective date of the amendments and by providing notice through email. If you do not agree to these amended terms, you may close your PayPal account within the 30-day period and you will not be bound by the amended terms."

If something seems off or you suspect fraud, please don’t complete the transaction. If you send money to the wrong person or fall victim to fraud, there is a danger that you may not be able to recover your funds.\nHere are some common scams to watch out for:\nBuyer Scam: a scammer sends you a fraudulent payment for goods or services. When accepting payments for goods or services, ask the buyer to mark the payment as a goods and services transaction.\n    Accidental Payment: a scammer sends you a fraudulent payment, claims it was accidental, and asks that you return their money.\n    Phishing: a scammer sends forged or faked electronic documents or emails falsely claiming to be PayPal or coming from PayPal but asks you to send money outside your PayPal account.\n    Relative in Need: a scammer impersonates a family member (commonly grandchildren) and claims there is an emergency requiring you to send money.\n    Lottery or Prize: a scammer informs you that you’ve won a lottery or prize and must send money in order to claim it.\n    Debt Collection: a scammer impersonates a debt collector and induces you to send money using threats or intimidation.\n    Employment Related: a scammer instructs you to send money in connection with a fraudulent offer of employment.\nAlways use common sense when sending money. If something sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Only send money for yourself and not for others. Be sure to verify the recipient’s identity before finalizing a transaction. Please let us know immediately if you believe someone is trying to scam or defraud you by contacting us. Learn more about how to avoid a scam by reading this FTC article.\nOnce a transaction is complete, there is a danger that your money may not be refunded. Double-check that you’re sending money to the right person and that the transaction is legitimate before proceeding.\nYou have the right to cancel a transaction for a full refund unless your designated recipient has already received the payment. However, since most PayPal payments are received within seconds, you may not be able to cancel your payment for a full refund once the payment is made. To determine whether your payment is eligible for cancellation, log in to PayPal.com, select the transaction in your transaction details, and select Cancel, or call PayPal Customer Service at 888-221-1161."
