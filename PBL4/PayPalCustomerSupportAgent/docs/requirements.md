## Project 3: üè¶ PayPal Customer Support Agent ‚Äì Payments, Disputes & Account Management

**Overview**

Build a support agent for PayPal users dealing with payment issues, transaction disputes, account limitations, refund requests, and international transfers. PayPal processes billions in transactions and handles complex scenarios like chargebacks, currency conversions, and buyer/seller protection. This agent must handle emotionally-charged situations (frozen accounts, disputed charges) with empathy while providing accurate policy information. The challenge is balancing self-service automation with appropriate escalation to human agents for sensitive financial matters.

**Real-World Inspiration**  
Modeled after [PayPal's Resolution Center](https://www.paypal.com/disputes/) and their chatbot that handles initial triage before escalating to specialists. PayPal uses AI to classify dispute types and suggest resolution paths.
