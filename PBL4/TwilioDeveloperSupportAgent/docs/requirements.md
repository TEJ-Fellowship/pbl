## Project 5: üåê Twilio Developer Support Agent ‚Äì API Integration & Debugging

**Overview**

Create a support agent for developers integrating Twilio's communication APIs (SMS, Voice, Video, WhatsApp). Twilio's developer-first platform requires the agent to understand code snippets, debug webhook issues, explain error codes, and guide API authentication. This is a highly technical support agent that must handle multiple programming languages (Node.js, Python, PHP, Ruby), interpret API logs, and suggest code fixes. The challenge is providing precise technical guidance while being accessible to developers of varying skill levels.

**Real-World Inspiration**  
Modeled after [Twilio's Support Center](https://support.twilio.com/) and their developer docs assistant. Twilio provides code-heavy documentation with language-specific examples and interactive API explorers.

**Data Sources**

- Twilio Help Center: https://support.twilio.com/
- API Documentation: https://www.twilio.com/docs/usage/api
- SMS Quickstarts: https://www.twilio.com/docs/sms/quickstart
- Voice Quickstarts: https://www.twilio.com/docs/voice/quickstart
- WhatsApp API: https://www.twilio.com/docs/whatsapp
- Video API: https://www.twilio.com/docs/video
- Error Codes: https://www.twilio.com/docs/api/errors
- Webhooks Guide: https://www.twilio.com/docs/usage/webhooks
- Node.js SDK: https://www.twilio.com/docs/libraries/node

**Tier 1: Basic RAG Chat** ‚è±Ô∏è _Days 1-3_

- Scrape API docs, SMS Quickstart, Error Codes, and Webhooks Guide
- Custom chunking preserving complete code examples (don't split mid-function)
- Metadata tags: `{api: sms/voice/video, language: nodejs/python/php, error_code: 21XXX}`
- Qdrant vector DB optimized for code similarity search
- Terminal Q&A: "How do I send an SMS in Node.js?", "What does error 30001 mean?"
- Code syntax highlighting in terminal output

**Tier 2: Production RAG + Context** ‚è±Ô∏è _Days 4-7_

- Multi-source: API docs for all products + SDK references + error catalog
- Hybrid search: Semantic + exact error code matching
- Code-aware chunking: Extract and index code separately from explanations
- React UI with Monaco Editor for code display and editing
- Conversation memory tracking: programming language preference, API being used
- Response format: Explanation ‚Üí Code example ‚Üí Common pitfalls
- Language-specific responses: Detect user's language from question context
- Re-ranking prioritizing most recent API version docs

**Tier 3: MCP + Advanced Features** ‚è±Ô∏è _Days 8-11_

- **MCP Tools:**
  - Web search for recent Twilio updates or known issues
  - Code validator: Check API endpoint URLs, required parameters
  - Twilio Status API: Check for service disruptions
  - Webhook tester: Validate webhook signatures and payload formats
  - Rate limit calculator: Estimate if user's volume exceeds limits
  - Code executor (sandboxed): Test simple Twilio API calls in test mode
- Query classification: `getting_started`, `debugging`, `error_resolution`, `best_practices`, `billing`
- Programming language detection from code snippets in questions
- Multi-turn debugging: Ask for error logs, guide through diagnostic steps
- Confidence-based code suggestions: Show multiple approaches if uncertain
- Error pattern recognition: "This error often occurs when..." with frequency data
- Analytics: Most common errors by API, language-specific pain points
- Feedback loop improving code example relevance

**Tier 4: Enterprise-Grade** ‚è±Ô∏è _Days 12-14_

- Multi-tenant for dev agencies building on Twilio for multiple clients
- Twilio API integration: Pull account usage, recent errors from Twilio logs
- Personalized debugging: "I see you had 15 webhook failures today. Here's why..."
- Code diff analyzer: Compare user's code to working examples, highlight issues
- A/B testing different code explanation styles (comments vs. separate explanation)
- GitHub integration: Read user's repo (with permission), suggest fixes in context
- Slack/Discord bot for developer community channels
- Admin dashboard: API adoption metrics, error resolution rate, documentation gaps
- Advanced RAG: Use code embeddings (StarCoder or CodeBERT) for better code search
- Automated testing with Twilio's actual error logs (if partnership allows)
- Human escalation for account-specific issues (billing, limits) with ticket creation
- CI/CD with code example regression testing (ensure all examples still work)
- Webhook signature validation service with real-time testing
- Cost optimization recommendations based on usage patterns

**Tech Stack:** React, Express, MongoDB, Qdrant, OpenAI Codex, MCP SDK, Twilio API, Monaco Editor
