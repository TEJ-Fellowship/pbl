Behind these APIs is a software layer connecting and optimizing communications networks around the world. With the Twilio APIs, you can build applications that help your users send messages, make phone calls, look up phone numbers, and more. In Twilio's ecosystem, each product corresponds to an API. For example, Twilio Messaging corresponds to the Messaging API. Although each API has its own unique features, they all share a common set of principles and practices. This consistency allows you to work with different Twilio APIs in a similar way. You can use the APIs directly over HTTPS or through Twilio SDKs available for several programming languages. In this section, you'll learn how to work with the Twilio APIs: Make requests to the Twilio APIs, including authenticating your requests, choosing the right content type, and handling webhooks. Work with Twilio API responses, including specifying response formats, paginating results, and handling errors. Handle mutations and conflicts. Learn about API best practices.",

They are triggered by some event in a web application and can facilitate integrating different applications or third-party APIs, like Twilio. Twilio uses webhooks to let your application know when events happen, such as receiving an SMS message or getting an incoming phone call. When the event occurs, Twilio makes an HTTP request (usually a or a (link takes you to an external page)) to the URL you configured for the webhook. Twilio's request will include details of the event such as the incoming phone number or the body of an incoming message. Many other modern web services like GitHub and Slack also make use of webhooks to communicate events. Expand image Some of these webhooks are informational (such as letting you know that a voice call recording is ready for download), and others require your web application to respond (for instance, letting Twilio know what to do when someone calls your Twilio phone number). Getting Started with Webhooksgetting-started-with-webhooks page anchorPositive FeedbackNegative FeedbackReady to start building webhooks for Twilio in your own web application? Listen to the following Twilio Tip, and read this guide to get started with webhooks. Webhooks by Productwebhooks-by-product page anchorPositive FeedbackNegative FeedbackEach Twilio product uses webhooks differently. To learn more about which webhooks each product uses, and how to set them up with your application, visit these pages: Voice Messaging Conversations Sync Twilio Runtime Webhookstwilio-runtime-webhooks page anchorPositive FeedbackNegative FeedbackWebhooks aren't just limited to products. You can also have Twilio send you webhooks when events occur in your application, such as billing levels reaching a certain threshold, or if an error occurs when Twilio calls your web application. You could set up a pipeline that sends your webhooks into Slack, Microsoft Teams, or another chat system. You could also set up a webhook that notifies you via email.Learn more about each of these areas on these pages: Debugging Events Webhook (Beta) REST API: Usage Triggers Want to learn more?want-to-learn-more page anchorPositive FeedbackNegative FeedbackGet an in-depth discussion of webhooks, learn how to validate that inbound webhooks are from Twilio, and read answers to questions from the Twilio developer community.

The Node library documentation can be found here. Versions uses a modified version of Semantic Versioning for all changes. See this document for details. Supported Node.js Versions This library supports the following Node.js implementations: Node.js 14 Node.js 16 Node.js 18 Node.js 20 Node.js lts(22) TypeScript is supported for TypeScript version 2.9 and above. Warning Do not use this Node.js library in a front-end application. Doing so can expose your Twilio credentials to end-users as part of the bundled HTML/JavaScript sent to their browser. Installation or Test your installation To make sure the installation was successful, try sending yourself an SMS message, like this: After a brief delay, you will receive the text message on your phone. Warning It's okay to hardcode your credentials when testing locally, but you should use environment variables to keep them secret before committing any code or deploying to production. Check out How to Set Environment Variables for more information. OAuth Feature for Twilio APIs We are introducing Client Credentials Flow-based OAuth 2.0 authentication. This feature is currently in beta and its implementation is subject to change. API examples here Organisation API examples here Usage Check out these code examples in JavaScript and TypeScript to get up and running quickly. Environment Variables supports credential storage in environment variables. If no credentials are provided when instantiating the Twilio client (e.g., ), the values in following env vars will be used: and . If your environment requires SSL decryption, you can set the path to CA bundle in the env var . Client Initialization If you invoke any V2010 operations without specifying an account SID, will automatically use the value that the client was initialized with. This is useful for when you'd like to, for example, fetch resources for your main account but also your subaccount. See below: CommonJS: Lazy Loading supports lazy loading required modules for faster loading time. Lazy loading is enabled by default. To disable lazy loading, simply instantiate the Twilio client with the flag set to : Enable Auto-Retry with Exponential Backoff supports automatic retry with exponential backoff when API requests receive an Error 429 response. This retry with exponential backoff feature is disabled by default. To enable this feature, instantiate the Twilio client with the flag set to . Optionally, the maximum number of retries performed by this feature can be set with the flag. The default maximum number of retries is . Set HTTP Agent Options allows you to set HTTP Agent Options in the Request Client. This feature allows you to re-use your connections. To enable this feature, instantiate the Twilio client with the flag set to . Optionally, the socket timeout and maximum number of sockets can also be set. See the example below: Specify Region and/or Edge To take advantage of Twilio's Global Infrastructure, specify the target Region and/or Edge for the client: Alternatively, specify the edge and/or region after constructing the Twilio client: This will result in the transforming from to . Iterate through records The library automatically handles paging for you. Collections, such as and , have and methods that page under the hood. With both and , you can specify the number of records you want to receive () and the maximum size you want each page fetch to be (). The library will then handle the task for you. eagerly fetches all records and returns them as a list, whereas streams records and lazily retrieves pages of records as you iterate over the collection. You can also page manually using the method. For more information about these methods, view the auto-generated library docs. Enable Debug Logging There are two ways to enable debug logging in the default HTTP client. You can create an environment variable called and set it to or you can set the logLevel variable on the client as debug: You can also set the logLevel variable on the client after constructing the Twilio client: Debug API requests To assist with debugging, the library allows you to access the underlying request and response objects. This capability is built into the default HTTP client that ships with the library. For example, you can retrieve the status code of the last response like so: Handle exceptions If the Twilio API returns a 400 or a 500 level HTTP response, will throw an error including relevant information, which you can then : or with : Using RestException for Better Error Handling For more specific error handling, you can import and use directly: ESM/ES6 Modules: CommonJS: If you are using callbacks, error information will be included in the parameter of the callback. 400-level errors are normal during API operation (\"Invalid number\", \"Cannot deliver SMS to that number\", for example) and should be handled appropriately. Use a Client with PKCV Authentication twilio-node now supports Public Key Client Validation authentication for Twilio APIs. To use this feature, refer to the example file. Additional documentation can be found on Public Key Client Validation Quickstart. Use a custom HTTP Client To use a custom HTTP client with this helper library, please see the advanced example of how to do so. Use webhook validation See example for a code sample for incoming Twilio request validation. Docker image The present in this repository and its respective Docker image are currently used by Twilio for testing purposes only.
